My research in maternal and child health (MNCH) focuses on designing and deploying technologies that can improve healthcare delivery in low-resource settings.

**Key Research Questions:**
- How can technology support community health workers?
- What are the barriers to technology adoption in healthcare settings?
- How can we design for sustainability and scale?

**Methods:** Participatory design, field studies, user research, prototype deployment

**Impact:** This work has informed the design of health information systems deployed across multiple countries.
