I am a <strong>Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information</strong>.

My work lies at the intersection of technology and social impact. Over the past few years, I have focused on designing technologies that can improve public service delivery in Maternal and Child Health (MNCH) and water and sanitation (WASH) in low income communities. I am particularly interested in questions around impact and scale. My more recent work focuses on mental health, particularly focusing on gender and forced displacement. I specialize in participatory design, and user experience (UX) research.

My research interests include: <strong>Human Computer Interaction</strong>, <strong>Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD)</strong>, and <strong>Health Informatics</strong>.
