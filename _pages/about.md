I am a __Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information__. Prior to this position, I was an ICTD Expert in Residence at the ATLAS Institute, University of Colorado Boulder. I received a Masters in Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) from the University of Colorado on a Fulbright Scholarship. 

My work lies at the intersection of technology and social impact. Over the past few years, I have focused on designing technologies that can improve public service delivery in Maternal and Child Health (MNCH) and water and sanitation (WASH) in low income communities. I am particularly interested in questions around impact and scale. My more recent work focuses on mental health, particularly focusing on gender and forced displacement. I specialize in participatory design, and user experience (UX) research.

My research interests include: __Human Computer Interaction__, __Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD)__, and __Health Informatics__.

My background spans across a multitude of countries and disciplines:
