I am a **Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information**. I received my PhD in Design Science from the University of Michigan (2025), a Masters in Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) from the University of Colorado Boulder on a Fulbright Scholarship, and a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from NUST, Pakistan.

My research integrates **AI/ML and Large Language Models** with **Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD)** to address global health challenges. I specialize in developing AI-powered solutions for Maternal and Child Health (MCH) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with over 10 years of field experience.

## Current Research Focus

- **Clinical AI Applications**: Developing empathy applicability frameworks for chatbots in healthcare settings
- **Responsible AI in Global Health**: Ensuring equitable, culturally-adaptive AI deployment with focus on bias mitigation
- **Voice-based Health Systems**: Deployed speech-based health platforms connecting underserved populations to healthcare information
- **Digital Safety**: Designing interventions for technology-facilitated gender-based violence

## Research Themes

My work spans three interconnected themes:

1. **Rethinking Information Access at the Last Mile** - Voice-first platforms for low-literate populations
2. **Designing Digital Safety in Patriarchal Contexts** - Understanding how women create safe digital experiences
3. **From Individual to Collective: Digital Adaptation** - Community-level approaches to digital literacy

My research has directly touched over **5 million lives** through interventions ranging from immunization systems deployed at provincial scale to COVID-19 information platforms serving tens of thousands of low-literate users.
