I am a **Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information**. Prior to this position, I was an ICTD Expert in Residence at the ATLAS Institute, University of Colorado Boulder. I received a Masters in Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) from the University of Colorado on a Fulbright Scholarship.

## Research Interests

My work lies at the intersection of technology and social impact. My research focuses on:

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Designing user-centered technologies for diverse populations
- **Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD)**: Technologies for low-resource settings
- **Health Informatics**: Digital health interventions in maternal and child health (MNCH) and mental health

I am particularly interested in questions around **impact and scale** in technology interventions. My recent work focuses on mental health, particularly in the context of gender and forced displacement. I specialize in **participatory design** and **user experience (UX) research**.

## Current Projects

- Designing technologies for improved public service delivery in Maternal and Child Health (MNCH)
- Water and sanitation (WASH) technologies for low-income communities
- Mental health support technologies for refugees and displaced populations

## News

- *I am on the academic job market for positions starting Fall 2025.*
