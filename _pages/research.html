<div class="intro">
<p>My work integrates critical analysis of structural inequality with pragmatic system design, grounded in over a decade of collaboration with marginalized communities in South Asia and diaspora communities in the US. Below are the key research areas and representative publications.</p>
</div>

<!-- Theme 1: Voice-Based Health Information Systems -->
<h2>Voice-Based Health Information Systems for Low-Literate Populations</h2>

<div class="theme-description">
Designing and evaluating speech-based platforms that bypass literacy and device barriers to connect underserved populations (particularly expecting fathers, mothers, and low-income patients) with health information and peer support.
</div>

<h3>Maternal and Child Health via Voice Platforms</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We identified demand for increased paternal engagement in maternal health, finding that men lack knowledge about their wives' health details and both genders perceive insufficient conversation (<a href="https://apha.confex.com/apha/2022/meetingapi.cgi/Paper/516094?filename=2022_Abstract516094.html&template=Word">Ahmad et al. 2022</a>), and we demonstrated that speech-based entertainment platforms are significantly more effective than text-based social media for reaching and retaining low-literate users while delivering health information (<a href="/files/chi2020_superabbuads-7.pdf">Naseem et al. 2020</a>; <a href="/files/2017-CHI--Maternal_Awareness_for_Low-Literate_Expecting_Parents_via_Voice-Based_Telephone_Services-2.pdf">St-Onge Ahmad et al. 2017</a>; <a href="/files/2017-CHI--Sustainable_IVR-Based_Social_Media_for_the_Developing_World.pdf">Kharal et al. 2017</a>).
</div>

<h3>Credible Health Information and Misinformation</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We tested three engagement mechanisms on a voice platform and found that targeted strategies increased health content creation 13-fold and information sharing 3-fold, but discovered a critical paradox: aggressive content moderation reduced misinformation by 97% yet paradoxically decreased overall exposure to beneficial health information by 21-29% (<a href="/files/www2022_spreadingcrediblehealthinformation-9.pdf">Raza et al. 2022</a>; <a href="/files/2023_misinformation pakistan.pdf">Hirshleifer et al. 2022</a>).
</div>

<h3>Voice Interface Design</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We tested the impact of voice gender and formality in IVR systems for low-literate populations in patriarchal contexts, finding that male participants trusted male voices more, formal voices made myths seem accurate to male participants, and female participants demonstrated greater knowledge of maternal health facts (<a href="/files/2020_Gender Accent IVR.pdf">Mubarak et al. 2020</a>).
</div>

<!-- Theme 2: Digital Safety in Patriarchal Contexts -->
<h2>Digital Safety in Patriarchal Contexts</h2>

<div class="theme-description">
Creating interventions that address technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including digital abuse, intimate partner violence, screenshot leakage, and coerced access. Understanding how women design digital spaces for safety when surveillance and control are structural features of their lives.
</div>

<h3>Digital Safe Spaces for Women</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We studied digital safe spaces in South Asia and found that they allow women to circumnavigate the patriarchal gaze and provide peer support (<a href="/files/ictd2020_patriarchy-4.pdf">Younas et al. 2020</a>), that creating these spaces empowers moderators contrary to existing literature portraying moderation as burden (<a href="/files/cscw2022_moderationempowerment-7.pdf">Ammari et al. 2022</a>), and that designing speech-based safe spaces for low-literate women requires navigating real-world constraints including novel authentication mechanisms like two-pin systems (<a href="/files/cscw2020_digitalsafespaces-7.pdf">Naseem et al. 2020</a>).
</div>

<h3>Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We found that image-based abuse in South Asian contexts functions fundamentally differently than Western frameworks, with perpetrators sharing culturally sensitive but non-sexual images with victims' male family members to cause severe social harm, revealing how social media companies' Western definitions fail to protect victims (<a href="/files/2024_NCIDA Image Abuse.pdf">Batool et al. 2024</a>); through global research, we found that women perceive greater harm from online harassment than men, especially for non-consensual image sharing, and prefer platform responses like content removal and user banning (<a href="/files/cscw2022_womens-perspectives-4.pdf">Im et al. 2022</a>).
</div>

<h3>Privacy and Digital Abuse in South Asia</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We found that Muslim-American women face intersectional online privacy risks across three dimensions (as Muslim-Americans broadly through Islamophobic harassment, as Muslim-American women specifically through reputational harm for taboo content, and based on individual religious practices), requiring digital privacy design principles that account for overlapping marginalized identities (<a href="/files/soups2022_auntiesstrangersfbi.pdf">Afnan et al. 2022</a>).
</div>

<!-- Theme 3: Community Digital Literacy & Capacity -->
<h2>Community Digital Literacy & Capacity</h2>

<div class="theme-description">
Developing literacy measures that capture how marginalized communities actually adopt technology, and designing "train-the-trainer" models to build sustainable community-driven digital capacity at scale.
</div>

<h3>Measuring and Assessing Digital Capacity</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We developed a novel measure of community digital capacity addressing a critical gap in individual digital literacy assessments, capturing three domains (individual, social, infrastructure) that reveal digital inequities in the context of systemic and structural challenges faced by marginalized populations (<a href="/files/2025_digital capacity measure.pdf">Dillahunt et al. 2025</a>); our exploratory analysis across 553 U.S. respondents identified a three-factor structure as a foundation for assessing whether people can access shared digital resources and activities (<a href="/files/lbw-2-3.pdf">Dillahunt et al. 2024</a>).
</div>

<h3>Implementing Digital Literacy in Marginalized Communities</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We found that Afghan refugees' adaptation strategies during resettlement are shaped by gender and collectivist cultural values, with strategic choices in support-seeking varying by shared versus non-shared identity with host community members, and tensions between economic adaptation and preserving sociocultural values, particularly through creative collective solutions by women (<a href="/files/2024_sociotechnical adaptation afghan refugees.pdf">Batool et al. 2024</a>); through interviews with co-design facilitators working in 43 countries, we found that power differentials based on educational background, language barriers, and gender prevent true collaboration, particularly when tools require literacy and advanced training (<a href="/files/compass2022_powerdifferentials-4.pdf">Jiang et al. 2022</a>); and we found that low-income African-American pregnant women seek information from multiple sources, treat formal medical sources no differently than other sources, and request material and social support alongside medical information, suggesting video testimonials by experienced mothers are particularly effective (<a href="/files/2020_african american pregnant women info seeking behavior.pdf">Burleson et al. 2020</a>).
</div>

<h3>Data Quality and Implementation Integrity</h3>
<div class="subtheme-summary">
We found that data falsification by front-line immunization workers in Pakistan is common, and that mid-level supervisors employ multiple detection strategies (triangulation, supplementary data collection, anomaly detection, interrogation) that correlate with their management style, with implications for designing technologies to monitor and manage front-line data (<a href="/files/chi2021_intentioanldatafalsification-2.pdf">Batool et al. 2021</a>).
