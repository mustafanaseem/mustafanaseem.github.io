<p>My research addresses a fundamental question: <strong>How can we design digital technologies to improve health and wellbeing for the world's most under-resourced communities?</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to the "last mile" of information, we have failed spectacularly. Billions of people with low literacy and limited internet are excluded from a digital world that remains resolutely textual. Over twelve years, I have pursued this question through three interconnected themes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Theme 1: Rethinking Information Access at the Last Mile</h2>

<p>The central problem is not solely distribution; it is distributing information that users can <em>use</em>, <em>trust</em>, and <em>act upon</em>. For low-literate populations, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems offer promise, yet prior approaches faced a tradeoff: rigid menus provide poor engagement while entertainment platforms deliver no health benefits.</p>

<h3>Key Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Super Abbu</strong>: A telephone hotline where 20,000 expectant fathers in Pakistan asked doctors maternal health questions. The platform revealed that spatial distance and anonymity enabled men to ask deeply taboo questions they would never ask in person.</li>
  <li><strong>Baang</strong>: A speech-based social media platform that delivered COVID-19 information to 12,500 users. Through this work, I developed the <em>Health Information Engagement Stack</em>, revealing why platforms optimized for viral growth systematically fail at health outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Net Exposure to Accurate Health Content</strong>: A new metric measuring total accurate information consumed minus misinformation, rather than just reduction rates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Facebook ads acquired retained users at $137 each; ads on speech-based platforms acquired them at $0.61 (225x improvement)</li>
  <li>Users engaging with official content were 13x more likely to create health content themselves</li>
  <li>Heavy moderation cut misinformation by 97% but reduced beneficial health information consumption by 21-29%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theme 2: Designing Digital Safety in Patriarchal Contexts</h2>

<p>Even on platforms designed for low-literate users, research found that 95% of posts aimed at women were threats, abuse, or flirtation. I sought to understand how women circumnavigate such hostile environments.</p>

<h3>Key Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Women-Only Digital Safe Spaces</strong>: Analyzing a 15,000-member women-only Facebook group in Pakistan, we found that nearly half of all posts were anonymous, enabling discussion of taboo topics like intimate partner violence and contraception.</li>
  <li><strong>Moderation as Empowerment</strong>: Using Naila Kabeer and Jo Rowlands' framework, we showed that moderating these spaces provided women with power-within (consciousness change), power-to (accessing resources), power-with (collective organizing), and power-through (change via social networks).</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Consensual Image Disclosure Abuse (NCIDA)</strong>: Working with Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency, we found that in honor-based cultures, the <em>threat</em> of sharing operates through anticipated family response—no actual image sharing need occur.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Awards</h3>

  <li><strong>CSCW 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Award</strong>: "Designing Digital Safe Spaces for Peer Support and Connectivity in Patriarchal Contexts"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theme 3: From Individual to Collective Digital Adaptation</h2>

<p>My third theme extends this lens to refugees navigating the transition to a digital economy. Sociotechnical adaptation is deeply gendered but collectively oriented.</p>

<h3>Key Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Afghan Refugee Adaptation Study</strong>: Men leveraged broad WhatsApp groups for employment knowledge, while women coordinated collective purchasing and emotional support. Both acted for the family unit, extending individualistic frameworks to encompass household-level adaptation.</li>
  <li><strong>Community Digital Capacity Measure</strong>: Challenging the assumption that digital literacy is an individual attribute, we developed a measure showing that a family's ability to navigate systems depends less on individual skill than on their network's collective resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Community Technology Worker (CTW) Program</strong>: Modeled on the community health worker model, we trained 26 technology workers from within the Afghan community. Workers prevented critical failures (e.g., missed school emails triggering CPS calls) but faced 24/7 demands.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p>My research trajectory raises a critical scaling question: <strong>How can we architect technology that amplifies vulnerable disclosure without amplifying vulnerability to exploitation?</strong></p>

<h3>Current Focus Areas</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Culturally-Conditional Reward Models</strong>: Moving beyond surface-level prompt engineering to fundamentally rethink Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for pluralistic values</li>
  <li><strong>Empathy Applicability Framework</strong>: Shifting empathy modeling from reactive labeling to anticipatory detection (F1 &gt; 87% in preliminary trials)</li>
  <li><strong>Community-Based Threat Detection</strong>: Supported by a 2025 Google Academic Research Award ($100K), investigating how to equip trusted intermediaries with tools to verify claims and flag emerging threats</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>This research has directly touched over <strong>5 million lives</strong> through interventions ranging from immunization systems deployed at provincial scale to COVID-19 information platforms serving tens of thousands of low-literate users.</p>
