## Overview

The Water ATM project designs water quality sensors and dispensing units that can be attached to community-run Water Filtration Plants funded by the Government of Punjab. The system provides real-time water quality monitoring and regulates usage through user authentication.

## Key Features

- **IoT-based sensors** for real-time water quality monitoring
- **User authentication mechanism** to regulate clean water usage
- **Automated dispensing** to prevent water wastage
- **Data collection** for understanding community water usage patterns

## Research Focus

The project spans multiple research areas:
- Sensor design for low-resource settings
- User interface and experience design for low-literate users
- Business model generation for sustainability
- Community impact assessment

## Funding

- **Pakistan-US Science and Technology Cooperation Program** (NAS & USAID) (2018-2020): $234,628
