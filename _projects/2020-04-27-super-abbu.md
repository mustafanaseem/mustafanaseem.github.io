## Overview

Super Abbu ("Super Dad" in Urdu) is a speech-based platform that allows low-literate, low-income men to communicate with doctors and exchange experiences around Maternal and Child Health (MNCH). The platform was designed to engage fathers in improving health outcomes for mothers and children.

## Impact

- **20,000+ expectant fathers** used the platform in the first 71 days after launch
- Platform enabled discussion of deeply **taboo topics** (abortion, sexual dysfunction, pleasure) that men would never ask in person
- Spatial distance and anonymity proved critical for vulnerable disclosure

## Research Findings

Our CHI 2020 Best Paper Honorable Mention compared seven recruitment strategies for Super Abbu:
- Facebook ads reached over 100,000 users but acquired retained users at **$137 each**
- Ads on Polly (a speech-based entertainment platform) acquired retained users at **$0.61 each** - a 225x improvement

This demonstrated that speech-based platforms can dramatically outperform text-based social media for reaching low-literate populations.

## Funding

- **Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation** (2021-2023): $272,138 for Pashto-language expansion
- **NIH** (2018-2020): $250,000 for randomized control trial
- **UNICEF Innovation Fund** (2016-2017): $100,000 for initial design and deployment
