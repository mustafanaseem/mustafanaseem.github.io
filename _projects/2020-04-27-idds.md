## Overview

The International Development Design Summit (IDDS) is a program organized in partnership with MIT D-Lab that brings together participants and organizers from diverse countries to co-create Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in sectors like health, education, agriculture, and income generation.

## My Role

I have served as Lead Instructor and Organizer for multiple IDDS summits:

- **IDDS Botswana** (2015, 2016, 2018): Lead instructor at D'kar Innovation Center, creating technologies to increase desert livelihoods. The 2018 summit created 8 technologies over 4 weeks.
- **IDDS Pakistan** (2016): Organized summit at Information Technology University, Lahore with 40 participants from 15 countries creating 6 ICT technologies
- **IDDS Tanzania** (2014): Instructor at VETA, Arusha
- **IDDS Ghana** (2011): Participant at KNUST, Kumasi

## Methodology

The summits follow a co-design curriculum focused on:
- Participatory design with marginalized communities
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Technology appropriate for low-resource settings
- Training local "makers" to sustain innovations

## Funding

- **IDIN Summit Grant**, MIT D-Lab (2016): $30,000 for organizing IDDS Pakistan

## Teaching

This work has informed my course **SI591: Humanitarian Innovation: Co-Design for Social Impact** at the University of Michigan School of Information.
