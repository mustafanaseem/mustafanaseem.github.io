## Overview

Har Zindagi ("Every Life Matters" in Urdu) is an Immunization Information System (IIS) designed and piloted with the Government of Punjab, Pakistan. The system allows for digital record creation of routine vaccinations in the field, and reminder notifications to parents through SMS and robocalls.

## Impact

- **7-month pilot** deployed across two districts of Punjab
- **17,000 children** vaccinated by 50 state-appointed vaccinators during pilot
- System now **scaled province-wide**, with 4 million children being immunized annually
- Research on detecting data falsification by front-line workers published at CHI 2021

## Key Innovations

- Digital vaccination record creation at point of care
- Automated reminder system via SMS and robocalls
- Anomaly detection algorithms to identify data falsification
- Mobile app for vaccinator supervisors to monitor immunization data

## Funding

- **DFID District Delivery Challenge Fund** (2015-2017): UK £250,000
- **Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation** Grand Challenges Round 21 (2018-2020): $100,000 for anomaly detection system
- **Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation** Grand Challenges Round 22 (2019-2020): $100,000 for supervisor dashboard
